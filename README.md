### Hi there, I am Vedran. ðŸ‘‹

You can read my name out loud as the first half of wed(ding) and first half of run(ning), ie. wed-run, which would roughly translate in English as Bright, Brighty, or Brighton. ðŸ˜Ž

- âš¡ Fun fact: I don't see all colors... ðŸŒˆ really.

I'm a full stack developer with over 12 years of professional experience with focus in web / enterprise solutions built on .NET. I'm skilled in building and maintaining .NET solutions but I like trying out new technologies.
